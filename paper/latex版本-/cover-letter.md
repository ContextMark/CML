## **Dear Editor,**

I am pleased to submit my research manuscript entitled *"Contextual Structure Expression: A Unified Modeling Framework for Semantic Contextual Markup"* for your consideration for publication in the *ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology (TIST)*.

This paper introduces a novel modeling framework for semantic context—**Contextual Structure Expression (CSE)**—and proposes a concise markup language based on this framework, called **Context Mark Language (CML)**. Unlike traditional structured formats such as JSON, YAML, and RDF that rely on static schemas, CML enables the expression of semantic structures in a form that can be embedded directly into natural language. This makes it particularly suitable for intelligent systems powered by large language models (LLMs), where context is inherently dynamic and meaning is often shaped by surrounding discourse.

In a landscape where knowledge is increasingly replacing information as the central focus of computational systems, we believe the ability to express semantic variability is becoming foundational. Just as the information age gave rise to Markdown—a markup language centered on information annotation—we argue that the AI era requires a new language focused on **semantic annotation**. CML aims to fulfill this need.

We believe *TIST* is the ideal venue for this work due to its ongoing commitment to publishing innovative research on intelligent systems, semantic modeling, and related foundational technologies. We hope that this work will contribute meaningfully to ongoing discussions in these areas and provide new perspectives for both researchers and practitioners.

This is the first submission of this work. It has not been published elsewhere, nor is it under consideration by any other journal. A preprint version was previously released for early dissemination.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration. I look forward to your feedback.

Sincerely,
 **Liwei Zhao**
